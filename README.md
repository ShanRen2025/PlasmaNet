# Prediction and Control of Plasma Instabilities Using Recurrent Neural Networks

## Abstract

Plasma instabilities are a critical challenge in both laboratory and astrophysical plasma systems, significantly impacting energy confinement, transport processes, and operational stability. Traditional approaches to analyzing and mitigating instabilities rely heavily on linear models or computationally expensive nonlinear simulations, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic and multi-scale environments. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models with kinetic corrections using data-driven techniques, providing an accurate and efficient description of plasma instabilities across scales. We propose an adaptive stabilization strategy that combines real-time diagnostics, advanced control mechanisms, and predictive feedback to suppress instabilities dynamically. 

Key innovations include a hybrid multi-scale model for capturing nonlinear instability evolution, machine learning-assisted wave-particle interaction modeling, and optimized control techniques such as resonant magnetic perturbations and radiofrequency heating. The framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating drift-wave turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and macroscopic instabilities. These advancements offer transformative potential for enhancing plasma performance in fusion devices, space physics, and industrial applications.
